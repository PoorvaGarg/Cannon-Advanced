# Cannon-Advanced
COL333 - Assignment 2 and 5

We created a bot using adversarial search techniques to play an abstract strategy board game named Cannon. The rules of the original game can be found [here](https://nestorgames.com/rulebooks/CANNON_EN.pdf). We implemented minimax along with alpha beta pruning. The code to the final player can be found in new_new.cpp

The TA repository for running the server is Cannon-AI and the repository can be found [here](https://github.com/goelShashank007/Cannon-AI)
